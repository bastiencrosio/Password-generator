# Welcome to my password generator

Made as a mean to check out React states a bit more, and to update my two years old army of passwords (Do not judge me, I know... And don't pretend you are not doing the same)

## Nothing crazy to see here

Indeed, even if it is fairly simple, feel free to contribute or add an issue if you want something added to it. it is not like you could find a better one somewhere else.
Right, right ?

## Absolutely efficient

Enjoy your completely un-rememberable new passwords. So efficient in fact that you will need to change them next time you want to login into your accounts, or use a password manager. Yeah, probably do that...
